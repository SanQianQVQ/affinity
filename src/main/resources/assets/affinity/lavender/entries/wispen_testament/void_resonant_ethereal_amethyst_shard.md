However useful tapping into the {c}Ethereal Fabric{} using a
[Sculk-Resonant Ethereal Amethyst Shard](^affinity:sculk_resonant_ethereal_amethyst_shard) is, the severely limited
transfer rate does limit the potential applications.


The {i}Void-Resonant Ethereal Amethyst Shard{} can, through its innate link to {c}the void{}, form concentrated

...of {c}virtually unlimited capacity{} in the {c}Ethereal Fabric{}.


Once inserted into an [Ethereal Aethum Flux Node](^affinity:ethereal_flux_transport) as normal, all injectors linked to
said node will receive [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux) {c}as quickly as its connected device can accept it{}. The
flux sent by the node is, of course, still evenly divided between all receiving injectors.
