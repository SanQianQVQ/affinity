Transmitting an amount of [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux) over long distances, while not necessarily the most
common of problems, does present itself to be a rather challenging one without proper equipment.


To this end, employing the all-encompassing {concept}Ethereal Fabric{} with the help of a pair of
[Sculk-Resonant](^affinity:sculk_resonant_ethereal_amethyst_shard)

;;;;;

[Ethereal Amethyst Shards](^affinity:sculk_resonant_ethereal_amethyst_shard) offers a solution.

<recipe;affinity:assembly/ethereal_aethum_flux_node>

An {item}Ethereal Aethum Flux Node{} is the principal device required and serves as a distribution hub from which...

...{concept}Aethum Flux{} is sent to any number of {item}Ethereal Aethum Flux Injector{}s.

<recipe;affinity:assembly/ethereal_aethum_flux_injector>

These humble gadgets, not even equipped with any {concept}Aethum Flux{} buffer of their own, {concept}inject directly
into the block they're attached to{} - supplied with the flux from

its linked node {concept}irrespective of physical or dimensional distance{}. It is also trivial to recognize that for
this mechanism to function, both the node's and injector's chunk must be loaded.

It is vital to note that, after placing, a {i}Sculk-Resonant Ethereal Amethyst Shard{} {c}must be inserted{} into the
{item}Ethereal Aethum Flux Node{}, ...

...seeing as (contrary to the injector) it does come with one of its own.

The {item}Ethereal Aethum Flux Node{} remembers its owner (read, the placer) and may be customized for ease-of-use.
{concept}Naming it in an anvil{} will make it retain this name when placed, visible for easy differentiation during injector setup. Further, a node
{concept}is only visible to{} (and thus usable by) {concept}its owner{} by

default. {concept}Sneak-interacting{} with it toggles between this and public access.


Now, to link an {item}Ethereal Aethum Flux Injector{} to a previously set-up node, {concept}interact with it{} after
placing and {concept}select the desired node{} in the thus-opened interface.
