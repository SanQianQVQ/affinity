There is not too much to say about the {i}Azalea Chest{}, for simpler an artifact hardly can be.


For most intents and purposes it behaves exactly like its plain, Crafting Table-born counterpart. However, being made of
[Azalea Wood](^affinity:wisp_forest) and crafted using [Aspen Infusion](^affinity:aspen_infusion), it {c}offers two
additional rows of space{}.

Thus, an {i}Azalea Double Chest{} can contain a full {c}90 stacks{} of items, where a plain double chest only holds 54.
