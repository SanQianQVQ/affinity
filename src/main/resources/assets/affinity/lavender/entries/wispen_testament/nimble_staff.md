...the {item}Nimble Staff{} acts much more akin to a fan. All entities in its area-of-effect will be propelled, with
considerable force, into one of the four cardinal directions - selected by {concept}sneak-scrolling{} while looking
at the {item}Staff Pedestal{} in use.


To tune this direction with more fidelity (and unlock the vertical axis), deposit a {item}bound Echo Shard{} into a
container at the pedestal's base. To bind an {item}Echo Shard{}, simply sneak-use it on a

block to remember its location. Thus configured, the {item}Nimble Staff{} will instead direct entities towards the
{item}Echo Shard{}'s bound location.
