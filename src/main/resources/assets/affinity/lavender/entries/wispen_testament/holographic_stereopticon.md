Among other things, you take note of {item}Amethyst{}'s innate ability to retain frequencies and get fascinated with the
concept - specifically, trying to extend it to the imprint of a living being. Along the way, as you tinker with 
many different substances, you discover that {item}Glowstone{} makes it possible to project a faint image
of the retained imprint above the vessel

;;;;;

<recipe;affinity:aspen_infusion/holographic_stereopticon>

you construct to contain this mechanism. Feeling reminded of a certain everyday 
device, you dub your invention the {item}Holographic Stereopticon{}.

At last, you figure out how to make it support {concept}4 different kinds of imprint:{}

 - Items
 - Blocks
 - Entities
 - World Sections

To configure the Stereopticon for a desired kind, {concept}right-click it in your inventory{} and observe the
instructions in the resulting tooltip. It should further be noted that any imprint

;;;;;

{concept}stays precisely like it was created{}, even once and if the imprinted object alters appearance.


Merely {concept}section imprints{} form an exception to this rule, as they constantly evolve to match
the changes in the world around them.


Finally, a placed Stereopticon {c}may be configured{} to alter the

display of its imprint. The constant rotation of said imprint may be disabled by {c}sneak-interacting{} with the
Stereopticon, and its size altered by {c}scrolling while sneaking{} and looking at the Stereopticon.
