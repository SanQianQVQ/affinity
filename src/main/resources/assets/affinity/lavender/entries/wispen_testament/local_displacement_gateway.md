A rather mundane solution to a mundane problem, the {i}Local Displacement Gateway{} provides a somewhat inappropriately
complex solution to the question "How do I get through this wall in my base" (and thereby an alternative to doors).


That is to say, upon {c}interacting with a side{}, the user will be {c}immediately{}

;;;;;

<recipe;affinity:assembly/local_displacement_gateway>

{c}teleported{} to the opposing side of the gateway (provided there is sufficient space on the other side, of course).


This operation comes with a small cost of [Aethum](^affinity:aethum), paid by the user.
